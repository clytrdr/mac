# --- Path for Homebrew ---
# This ensures that binaries installed by Homebrew are found first.
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# --- Plugin Manager (zinit) ---
# If you haven't installed zinit, run this command first:
# sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/zinit-install)"
source ~/.zinit/bin/zinit.zsh

# --- Load Recommended Plugins ---
# Syntax highlighting for commands
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
# Suggests commands as you type based on history
zinit light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
# fzf (fuzzy finder) integration - makes history search (Ctrl+R) powerful
# (It's recommended to install fzf itself via `brew install fzf`)
zinit light-mode for \
    junegunn/fzf-bin \
    junegunn/fzf

# --- Completion System Setup ---
# Initialize the completion system
autoload -Uz compinit
# Speed up compinit by using a cache file
if [ -n ~/.zcompdump(N.mh+24) ]; then

# --- Git Prompt Setup ---
# The git-prompt.sh and git-completion.bash scripts are often included with
# the git installation from Homebrew. Sourcing them from there is a good practice.
# e.g., source /opt/homebrew/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh
source ~/.zsh/git-prompt.sh
fpath=(~/.zsh $fpath)
zstyle ':completion:*:*:git:*' script ~/.zsh/git-completion.bash

# Configure the information shown in the git prompt
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=true
GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=true
GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=true
GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM=auto

# --- Prompt Configuration ---
# Enable command substitution in the prompt
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
# Display Git info on the right prompt (RPROMPT) for better readability with long paths
RPROMPT='%F{red}$(__git_ps1 "(%s)")%f'
# Set the main prompt (PS1): user@host: current_directory $
PS1='%F{green}%n@%m%f: %F{cyan}%~%f \$ '

# --- History Configuration ---
HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history      # History file path
HISTSIZE=10000               # Number of lines to keep in memory
SAVEHIST=10000               # Number of lines to save in the history file
setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST   # Expire duplicates first when trimming history
setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS         # Don't record an event if it's a duplicate of the previous one
setopt HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS        # When searching, find the newest entry without duplicates
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE        # Don't save commands that start with a space
setopt SHARE_HISTORY            # Share history between all sessions

# --- Useful Options (setopt) ---
setopt AUTO_CD              # cd to a directory just by typing its name
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB        # Enable extended globbing (e.g., ls ^*.txt)
setopt NOTIFY               # Notify on completion of long-running jobs

# --- Aliases ---
# Common aliases for convenience
alias ls='ls -G'            # Enable colors for ls on macOS
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias g='git'
alias gst='git status'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'

# User-specific aliases (from your original config)
alias gemi="gemini --yolo"
