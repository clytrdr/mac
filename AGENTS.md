# Project Context

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and configurations to manage the local development environment for a MacBook Air.

## Primary Goal
The user's primary objective is to develop a Python-based system for machine learning-driven cryptocurrency trading.

## Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform is used for managing the cloud infrastructure.

## Guidelines for AI Agents
1. **Context Awareness:**
   - The local environment setup is designed to support Python development, specifically for data science and machine learning tasks.
   - Integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Terraform is essential.

2. **Tooling & Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the Ansible roles properly configure essential tools such as the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`), Terraform, and Python environment management tools.
   - Adhere to the existing structure and patterns found in the `roles/` and `vars/` directories.

3. **Development Focus:**
   - Prioritize configurations that enhance the workflow for machine learning and algorithmic trading development.
